        "answer": "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto is Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).. It requires 6 cups chicken broth, divided ; 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided ; 1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced ; 1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced ; 2  shallots, diced ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups Arborio rice ; \u00bd cup dry white wine ;   sea salt to taste ;   freshly ground black pepper to taste ; 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives ; 4 tablespoons butter ; \u2153 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese. In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat. Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste."

You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!!  It yields a soft, chewy crust.  For a real treat, I recommend you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy!. It requires 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast ; 1 teaspoon white sugar ; 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups bread flour ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 1 teaspoon salt. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving."

Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined. 5. Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika. 6. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes."

The creamy cheese sauce and the tender potatoes in this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive experience. It's a great side dish with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin. Add a green salad and French bread, and you have found the magic path to a man's heart. To avoid lumps in your sauce, add the milk just a little at a time as you stir the flour and butter. Experiment with different cheeses for variety..

        "answer": "Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.. It requires 1 pound uncooked spaghetti ; 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced ; \u00bd cup olive oil ; \u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste ;   salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste ; \u00bc cup chopped fresh Italian parsley ; 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.

        "answer": "Old Fashioned Onion Rings is This is an actual recipe from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant. Crispy coated onion rings like the pro's make!. It requires 1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices ; 1\u2009\u00bc cups all-purpose flour ; 1 teaspoon baking powder ; 1 teaspoon salt ; 1  egg ; 1 cup milk, or as needed ; \u00be cup dry bread crumbs ;   seasoned salt to taste ; 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings. Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve."

It was our very favorite Thanksgiving vegetable. If you have children, or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish! Even though I rarely cook with canned condensed soups, I still make this yummy broccoli casserole during the holiday season. It's fabulous with a Christmas ham and potatoes au gratin too. Mmmmmmm!. It requires 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup ; 1 cup mayonnaise ; 1  egg, beaten ; \u00bc cup onions, chopped ; 3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli ; 8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese ;   salt and pepper to taste ; 1 dash paprika. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together condensed soup, mayonnaise, egg and onions. Place frozen broccoli into a very large mixing bowl. (I like to use my large stainless steel bowl to mix this recipe thoroughly.) Break up the frozen broccoli. Using a rubber spatula, scrape soup-mayonnaise mixture on top of broccoli, and mix well. Sprinkle on cheese, and mix well. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish, and smooth top of casserole. Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Absolute Best Liver and Onions?",
        "answer": "Absolute Best Liver and Onions is This recipe will turn liver haters into converts.  Very simple! The three things that will set your liver above all others are: 1) soak in milk, 2)turn liver as little as possible and 3) don't overcook!. It requires 2 pounds sliced beef liver ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups milk, or as needed ; \u00bc cup butter, divided ; 2 large Vidalia onions, sliced into rings ; 2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed ;   salt and pepper to taste. Gently rinse liver slices under cold water, and place in a medium bowl. Pour in enough milk to cover. Let stand while preparing onions. (I like to soak up to an hour or two - whatever you have time for.)  This step is SO important in taking the bitter taste of the liver out. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Separate onion rings, and saute them in butter until soft. Remove onions, and melt remaining butter in the skillet. Season the flour with salt and pepper, and put it in a shallow dish or on a plate. Drain milk from liver, and coat slices in the flour mixture. When the butter has melted, turn the heat up to medium-high, and place the coated liver slices in the pan. Cook until nice and brown on the bottom. Turn, and cook on the other side until browned. Add onions, and reduce heat to medium. Cook a bit longer to taste.  Our family prefers the liver to just barely retain a pinkness on the inside when you cut to check. Enjoy!"

It's relatively cheap and easy to make, but maybe more importantly, it's great hot, warm, or room temp. And it's also incredibly versatile.. It requires 2 pounds extra lean ground beef ; 2  green bell peppers, diced ; 1  onion, diced ; 4 cloves garlic, minced ; 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour ; 2 tablespoons brown sugar ; 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste ; 1 teaspoon ground black pepper ;   cayenne pepper, to taste ; 2 cups chicken broth ; 1 cup ketchup ; 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard ; 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce ; 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided. Place ground beef, bell pepper, onion, garlic, flour, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a heavy pot. Place pot over medium-high heat. Break up and stir mixture as it heats. Cook and stir until most of the moisture has evaporated and mixture is crumbly and begins to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in chicken broth, ketchup, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thick, about 45 minutes. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Transfer mixture to oven-proof sauce pan. Top with 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Poke cheese down into the dip with a fork, stirring lightly. Top with remaining cheese. Place pan under broiler; broil until cheese is browned, and mixture is hot and bubbly, about 5 minutes."

The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.. It requires \u2153 cup chicken broth ; 1 tablespoon oyster sauce ; 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed ; 2 teaspoons fish sauce ; 1 teaspoon white sugar ; 1 teaspoon brown sugar ; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil ; 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped ; \u00bc cup sliced shallots ; 4 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper ; 1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves ; 2 cups hot cooked rice. Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended. Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute. Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice."

      {
        "question": "What is the recipe for How to Make Perfect Polenta?",
        "answer": "How to Make Perfect Polenta is Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a perfect base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.. It requires 4 cups water ; 1 teaspoon fine salt ; 1 cup polenta ; 3 tablespoons butter, divided ; \u00bd cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish. Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly into boiling water, whisking constantly until all polenta is stirred in and there are no lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes. When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender. Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until butter partially melts; mix  1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand 5 minutes to thicken; stir and taste for salt before transferring to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo?",
        "answer": "Good New Orleans Creole Gumbo is I am going to give you my gumbo recipe. I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!. It requires 1 cup all-purpose flour ; \u00be cup bacon drippings ; 1 cup coarsely chopped celery ; 1 large onion, coarsely chopped ; 1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 1 pound andouille sausage, sliced ; 3 quarts water ; 6 cubes beef bouillon ; 1 tablespoon white sugar ;   salt to taste ; 2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco\u00ae), or to taste ; \u00bd teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend (such as Tony Chachere's\u00ae), or to taste ; 4  bay leaves ; \u00bd teaspoon dried thyme leaves ; 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes ; 1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce ; 4 teaspoons file powder, divided ; 2 tablespoons bacon drippings ; 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed ; 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar ; 1 pound lump crabmeat ; 3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined ; 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Make a roux by whisking the flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings together in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat to form a smooth mixture. Cook the roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. Place the celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until the vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir the vegetables into the roux, and mix in the sausage. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside. Bring the water and beef bouillon cubes to a boil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Stir until the bouillon cubes dissolve, and whisk the roux mixture into the boiling water. Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in the sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer the soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in a skillet, and cook the okra with vinegar over medium heat for 15 minutes; remove okra with slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Just before serving, stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder."

Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate. In a small jar, combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.

Lay the ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from the coals, if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low, close lid, and leave undisturbed for 1 hour. Do not lift the lid at all.

        "answer": "Chef John's Chicken Paprikash is After many, many requests, I'm excited to be sharing what is my second favorite Hungarian dish of all time. I really love making anything Hungarian, since the recipes tend to be simple and easy to make, as well as comforting and delicious, and the names are never not fun to say. Top with extra sour cream and freshly sliced chives on top.. It requires 8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs ;   salt to taste ; 2 tablespoons olive oil ; 2 medium yellow onions, diced ; 3 cloves garlic, minced ; 2 tablespoons tomato paste ; 4 teaspoons all-purpose flour ; 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste ; \u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ; 1 teaspoon smoked paprika ; \u00bc cup sweet Hungarian paprika ; 1 pinch cayenne pepper ; 2 cups chicken broth ; \u2154 cup sour cream, room temperature ; \u00bc cup heavy whipping cream. Season chicken generously on both sides with salt. Heat olive oil in a heavy, deep-sided pan (that comes with a lid) over high heat and brown the chicken well, skin-side down, about 5 minutes; flip and continue to sear until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Turn off heat. Transfer the browned chicken to a plate and reserve until needed; spoon out excess chicken fat if desired. Add onions and a pinch of salt to the same pan and saute over medium until golden, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, tomato paste, and flour and cook, stirring, another 3 to 4 minutes to form a tomato roux. Stir in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, smoked paprika, and sweet paprika and cook for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and transfer chicken and accumulated juices back into the pan. Baste the tops with the sauce, cover the pan with the lid, and simmer, basting occasionally with the sauce, until the chicken is no longer pink in the centers and is fork-tender, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove the chicken and transfer to a plate. Skim some fat off the top of the sauce if desired. Whisk heavy cream and sour cream into the sauce and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Transfer the chicken and any juices back into the sauce. Simmer, uncovered, basting often, until chicken is heated through and very tender, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed."

Like most sweet loaves, it tastes best when allowed to sit for a day, wrapped in plastic wrap.. It requires 1  lemon ; 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar ; \u00be cup white sugar ; \u00bc cup melted butter ; 2  eggs ; \u00bc cup sour cream ; \u2153 cup milk ; 1\u2009\u2154 cups all-purpose flour ; 2 teaspoons baking powder ; \u00bc teaspoon salt ; 1\u2009\u00bc cups frozen blueberries. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Grate the zest from the lemon onto a small plate. Cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice from both halves. Make a topping by whisking together 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. Whisk together the white sugar, melted butter, eggs, sour cream, the remaining lemon zest, and the remaining lemon juice in a large bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the milk; set aside. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Remove 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture and set aside. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour the milk mixture into the well and stir the batter just until combined. Fold the frozen blueberries into the reserved 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture, then fold the blueberries into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Remove from oven; immediately poke holes all over the top of the loaf with a toothpick, and pour the topping evenly over the loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack."

Cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice from both halves. Make a topping by whisking together 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. 3. Whisk together the white sugar, melted butter, eggs, sour cream, the remaining lemon zest, and the remaining lemon juice in a large bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the milk; set aside. 4. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Remove 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture and set aside. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour the milk mixture into the well and stir the batter just until combined. 5. Fold the frozen blueberries into the reserved 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture, then fold the blueberries into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. 6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. 7. Remove from oven; immediately poke holes all over the top of the loaf with a toothpick, and pour the topping evenly over the loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack."

I've made this numerous times for my picky eater son and my southern-raised better half, as well as other family and friends. I get nothing but rave reviews each time.. It requires 4 (1/2 pound) beef cube steaks ; 2 cups all-purpose flour ; 2 teaspoons baking powder ; 1 teaspoon baking soda ; 1 teaspoon black pepper ; \u00be teaspoon salt ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups buttermilk ; 1  egg ; 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco\u2122) ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 3 cups vegetable shortening for deep frying ; \u00bc cup all-purpose flour ; 4 cups milk ;   kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste. Pound the steaks to about 1/4-inch thickness. Place 2 cups of  flour in a shallow bowl. Stir together the baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt in a separate shallow bowl; stir in the buttermilk, egg, Tabasco Sauce, and garlic. Dredge each steak first in the flour, then in the batter, and again in the flour. Pat the flour onto the surface of each steak so they are completely coated with dry flour. Heat the shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fry the steaks until evenly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Place fried steaks on a plate with paper towels to drain. Drain the fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid and as much of the solid remnants as possible. Return the skillet to medium-low heat with the reserved oil. Whisk the remaining flour into the oil. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy. Stir in the milk, raise the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer, cook until thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Spoon the gravy over the steaks to serve."

I've used the combination of pork, beef and veal and they are equally good. Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety...it really does make a difference.. It requires 1 pound ground beef ; \u00bd pound ground veal ; \u00bd pound ground pork ; 2 cloves garlic, minced ; 2  eggs ; 1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley ;   salt and ground black pepper to taste ; 2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled ; 1\u2009\u00bd cups lukewarm water ; 1 cup olive oil. Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper. Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs. Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)"

        "question": "What is the recipe for Enchiladas Verdes?",
        "answer": "Enchiladas Verdes is I learned this recipe from an amazing cook from Puebla. I've been perfecting it for over 15 years and realized that it was time to share it when my foodie friends tried to drink the sauce out of the saucepan. I use the roasted or baked chicken from the grocery store. I did it once only to save time, but found that they are tastier. Be conservative with the cream and the cheese. Do not use sour cream!. It requires 2 cloves garlic ; 3  serrano peppers ; 2\u2009\u00bc pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed ; 1 cup vegetable oil for frying ; 9  corn tortillas ; 3 cups water ; 4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules ; \u00bd  store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded ; \u00bc head iceberg lettuce, shredded ; 1 cup cilantro leaves ; 1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca ; 1 cup grated cotija cheese. Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high. Cook the garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot griddle until toasted and blackened, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers, and 15 minutes for the tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool. Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using kitchen tongs, fry the tortillas individually, turning them once. They shouldn't be in the hot oil for more than 5 seconds per side. Remove excess oil with paper towels and keep warm. Remember that the hotter the oil, the less that the tortillas will absorb. Place the toasted garlic, serrano peppers, tomatillos, and the water in a blender and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve the chicken bouillon into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The sauce shouldn't be too thick. Soak three tortillas in the sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds, fill them with shredded chicken, sprinkle the meat with some of the sauce, roll them and place them seam side down on a pasta bowl. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over them and top them with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour a little more sauce over the whole thing if desired. Repeat the procedure twice more. Serve immediately."

        "answer": "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9-inch square baking pan. 2. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chopped onion, green onions, and garlic in the hot oil until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and parsley, and continue to saute until spinach is limp, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. 3. Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl until well combined. Stir in spinach mixture. 4. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo dough; the sheets will overlap the pan. 5. Spread spinach and cheese mixture into the pan. Fold any overhanging dough over the filling. Brush with oil. 6. Layer the remaining 4 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil. Tuck overhanging dough into the pan to seal the filling. 7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. 8. Cut into squares and serve while hot."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Chef John's Milk Bread?",
        "answer": "Chef John's Milk Bread is Japanese-style milk bread is easy to make and stays moist and fresh longer than your typical loaf of homemade bread thanks to a starter or \"roux.\" It's light and soft with the perfect amount of sweetness. Try it with my Japanese Egg Salad Sandwich (Tamago Sando) or toast it and use it for a tuna salad sandwich.. It requires \u00bc cup bread flour ; \u00bc cup water ; \u2153 cup whole milk ; 2\u2009\u00bd cups bread flour ; 1\u2009\u00bc teaspoons kosher salt ; \u00bc cup white sugar ; 1 (.25 ounce) package instant dry yeast ; \u00bd cup warm whole milk (110 degrees F (43 degrees C)) ; 1 large egg, beaten ; 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cubed ; 1 tablespoon milk, or as needed. Whisk bread flour, water, and milk for starter together in a small saucepan until very smooth. Place over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, until very thick and just about to bubble. If you want to check, it should be at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Pull off the heat and transfer into a measuring cup; you will need exactly 1/2 cup. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Prepare dough: Combine bread flour, cooled starter, salt, sugar, yeast, warm milk, and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Beat on low speed until dough begins to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl, scraping down the sides as needed, about 5 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape dough off the hook and into the bowl. Add butter and knead on low speed until dough is slightly tacky but very smooth and elastic, scraping down the sides as needed, 10 to 12 more minutes. Remove dough from the bowl and shape into a smooth ball. Transfer into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Very generously butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Transfer dough to a work surface (you don't need flour.) Press and knead out all the air and shape into a 9-inch wide rectangle. Starting at one 9-inch side, roll dough lengthwise into a log. Transfer log into the prepared loaf pan with the seam down. Press on dough a bit to be sure it's evenly distributed. Cover the pan and let dough rise until it comes to just about the top of the pan, 35 to 45 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with just enough milk to lightly coat the surface. Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the load is beautifully puffed up, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for 10 minutes. Very carefully remove bread and place on a wire rack to cool all the way to room temperature before slicing, about 1 hour."

Combine the orange, lemon, and lime juice in a large glass or ceramic bowl along with the garlic, soy sauce, chipotle pepper, chili power, ground cumin, paprika, dried oregano, black pepper, and cilantro. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until marinade is well combined.  Remove one cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the meat is cooked. Place the flank steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork.  Add the meat to the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the steak from the marinade and grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium rare. Discard used marinade.  Remove meat from heat and slice across the grain. Pour the one cup of reserved, unused marinade over the hot meat and serve immediately."

Turn the peppers often to blacken all sides. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl, and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Rinse cooled peppers under cold water to peel off the skins, and cut a slit along the long side of each pepper to remove the seeds and core. Rinse the peppers inside and out, and pat dry with paper towels. Stuff the peppers with strips of the cheese. Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl with the baking powder. In a second metal bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until the whites form stiff peaks. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk mixture. Place flour into a shallow bowl.

Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic.  Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.  Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.  Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl.  Divide each half into 12 parts. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square.   Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.  Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns.  At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.  Cover wok with lid.  Steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish \"blisters\" on bun surfaces. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked."

        "question": "What is the recipe for Bucatini Cacio e Pepe (Roman Sheep Herder's Pasta)?",
        "answer": "Bucatini Cacio e Pepe (Roman Sheep Herder's Pasta) is This peasant food comes from Roman sheep herders who had little time and money to spend on eating. They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream, then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: this was perfect for them and for us even today!. It requires 1 teaspoon salt ; 1 pound bucatini (dry) ; 2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese ; 1\u2009\u00bd tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese contains no lumps. Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much. Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed. Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed. Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately."
