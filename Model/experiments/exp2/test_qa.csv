What is the recipe for Chicken Parmesan?,"Chicken Parmesan is My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.. It requires 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 eggs 1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed cup grated Parmesan cheese 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed 1 cup olive oil for frying cup prepared tomato sauce cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes cup chopped fresh basil cup grated provolone cheese cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon olive oil. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. Place flour in a sifter or strainer sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides. Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes. Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.

What is the recipe for Enchiladas Verdes?,"Enchiladas Verdes is I learned this recipe from an amazing cook from Puebla. I've been perfecting it for over 15 years and realized that it was time to share it when my foodie friends tried to drink the sauce out of the saucepan. I use the roasted or baked chicken from the grocery store. I did it once only to save time, but found that they are tastier. Be conservative with the cream and the cheese. Do not use sour cream!. It requires 2 cloves garlic 3 serrano peppers 2 pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed 1 cup vegetable oil for frying 9 corn tortillas 3 cups water 4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded head iceberg lettuce, shredded 1 cup cilantro leaves 1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca 1 cup grated cotija cheese. Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high. Cook the garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot griddle until toasted and blackened, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers, and 15 minutes for the tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool. Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using kitchen tongs, fry the tortillas individually, turning them once. They shouldn't be in the hot oil for more than 5 seconds per side. Remove excess oil with paper towels and keep warm. Remember that the hotter the oil, the less that the tortillas will absorb. Place the toasted garlic, serrano peppers, tomatillos, and the water in a blender and blend until smooth pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve the chicken bouillon into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The sauce shouldn't be too thick. Soak three tortillas in the sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds, fill them with shredded chicken, sprinkle the meat with some of the sauce, roll them and place them seam side down on a pasta bowl. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over them and top them with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour a little more sauce over the whole thing if desired. Repeat the procedure twice more. Serve immediately."
