Utility functions and experiments are separated into individual cells for clarity, modularity, and ease of explanation. The notebook includes:\n",
    "- Isolated utility functions for data processing, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "- Four experiments run sequentially with clear outputs.\n",
    "- Visualizations of training metrics and experiment comparisons.\n",
    "- Comprehensive logging and step-by-step result display.\n",
    "- Interactive testing with the best model.\n",
